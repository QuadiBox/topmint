This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Project QuadVerse

Project QuadVox is a personal portfolio website, build by a entry-level Front-end developer aiming to perfect and polish his programming skill.

This website is currently running locally on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) at the time of this writing.

I'm just about to start the project, hopeful it comes out great. Fingers crossed.
